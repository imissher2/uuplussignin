No problem, here is a guide for everyone:

Open vanilla app, enter email, click next
Copy the link to Notes app
Open uYou+, enter email, click next
Copy the link
Open the shortcut (https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/cfcc068dfeab4d09a5370fb5126bb58e) , type in the uYou+ link
The dialog will disappear for 10 seconds. In the meanwhile, go to your Notes app and copy the link from vanilla app.
Once the dialog appears, paste the link from Notes app.
A new login page will appear, type in your password and continue.
A popup dialog will open and ask to continue in Youtube app, click Open.
Click Done at the upper left corner
